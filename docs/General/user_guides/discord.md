# Our Discord Server

Discord is our main/offical method of non VOIP communication. It is here where you can find support and help when setting up your phone and such. 

To join our Discord, use the following link:

  * [Our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6VgdWw3vM4)

After joining, we ask that you do a couple of things:

* Make sure to read the ```#rules-read-first``` channel
* Please change your server nickname to be the format of CALLSIGN-Name-EXT. Your actual user name can be anything you want.
    * The nice thing about Discord is you have one over all username, but you can set your server nickname to be anything on any server. It can be different on every server.
    * To change your server nickname:
        * Right click on the Server Icon
        * Go to ```Edit Server Profile```
        * Change the field that says ```Server Nickname```
        * If it says you need to pay for Discord Nitro, you are doing it wrong. Server Nicknames are free to set.
