# Getting Started

Thank you for choosing Hams Over IP! We are happy to have you here! There are other Ham Radio VOIP Services out there, but we are glad you chose to get an extension with us.

One of the nice things about this system is it is a "Bring Your Own Device" kind of thing. We will give you your credentials and allow you to configure your phone yourself. We also allow up to 10 endpoints (different phones) on your account. Because we put the onus of phone configuration back on the user, you will need to be familiar with configuring your device.

In order to get started, you will need to enter a ticket in our ticketing system. Please go to [https://hamsoverip.com](https://hamsoverip.com) and click on the Enter Ticket icon and put a ticket in. This will get the process started.

Some things to keep in mind:

* Once your extension is provisioned, you will get sent an email with your credentials. 
* When configuration screens ask for a user name, your user name is your extension number.
* You can use whatever device you want, but you will need to know how to configure it. Also know that we can support alot of phones, but there are a few that we receommend to make helping the end user easier.
