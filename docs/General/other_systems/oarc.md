Online Amateur Radio Community (OARC) Call is a VOIP Telephone Network, much the same as the Hams Over IP Network. This network was concieved during the COVID Pandemic as a way for hams int he UL to stay connected while being on lockdown. The community has grown to an international community of collaboration. While the community is centered around their Discord Server, they have also created a SIP based PBX network for their members to be able to call each other on VOIP IP Phones. 

Hams Over IP has a trunk line connected to the OARC network, which allows users from both networks to call each other.

More information about the community and organization can be found on their website at [https://www.oarc.uk/](https://www.oarc.uk/).
