# Configuring Jami SIP Client for HOIP

Jami is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) solution for a SIP client. They do provide their own service, but this is not required to make this application work. This client is able to connect directly to a SIP provider without a Jami Login.

The client is available for all major desktop platforms (Windows, MacOS and Linux) as well as all iOS and Android.

Each Platform requires slightly different ways to set up, but for the most part, all the things you will need to change will be pretty easy to find and configure.

## Configure for Desktop Platform.

**Note:** You do not need to setup a Jami account for this to work. DO NOT USE THAT METHOD. This Client will connect directly to a SIP provider.
