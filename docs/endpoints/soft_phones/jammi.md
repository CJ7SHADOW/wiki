# Configuring Jami SIP Client for HOIP

Jami is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) solution for a SIP client. They do provide their own service, but this is not required to make this application work. This client is able to connect directly to a SIP provider without a Jami Login.

The client is available for all major desktop platforms (Windows, MacOS and Linux) as well as all iOS and Android. (Note that for MacOS, it is also available in the MacOS App Store in addition to being a direct download.)

Each Platform requires slightly different ways to set up, but for the most part, all the things you will need to change will be pretty easy to find and configure.

Jami is available for download from: [https://jami.net/download/](https://jami.net/download/)


## Configure for Desktop Platform.

**Note:** You do not need to setup a Jami account for this to work. DO NOT USE THAT METHOD. This Client will connect directly to a SIP provider.

First you will need to download and install the client to your desktop platform (How that is done varies from platform to platform and is outside the scope of this document). Once it is installed, open the application.

* When the initial screen comes up asking if you want to ```Join Jami``` or ```I already have an Existing Account``` don't choose either. Look for the option marked ```Advanced Features``` and click that and then click the option that says ```Configure a SIP Account```.
